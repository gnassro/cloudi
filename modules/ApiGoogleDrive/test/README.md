# DrEdit for PHP


A walkthrough and more details are available on
[Google Drive SDK docs](https://developers.google.com/drive/examples/php).

## Setup Instructions

1. [Create a new Google App Engine application](https://appengine.google.com/)
1.  Clone DrEdit's git repo and init submodules:

        git clone git@github.com:googledrive/dredit.git && cd dredit
        git submodule init
        git submodule update --recursive
1. Create an API project in the [Google APIs Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/).
1. Select the **Services** tab in your API Project, and enable the Drive API and Drive SDK.
1. Select the **API Access** tab in your API Project, click **Create an OAuth 2.0 client ID**.
1. In the **Branding Information** section, provide a name for your application (e.g. "DrEdit"), and click Next. Providing a product logo or a homepage URL is optional.
1. In the **Client ID Settings** section, do the following:
    1. Select **Web application** for the **Application type**
    1. Click the **more options** link next to the heading, **Your site or hostname**.
    1. List the URI of your application's URL in the **Authorized Request URIs** and **JavaScript Origins** fields.
    1. Click **Create Client ID**.
1. Register DrEdit as described in [Enable the Drive SDK](https://developers.google.com/drive/enable-sdk) using the following values:
    1. Set the default MIME types `text/plain` and `text/html`, and the default extensions `txt` and `html`.
    1. Ensure that the set of redirect URIs includes the URI of your application. The same URL must be provided for the `Open URL` and `Create URL` fields.
    1. Add the `Google API Scopes` of `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile` and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.install`.
    1. For icons, use the example icons  provided in the `chromewebstore` directory.
1. Copy the contents of the `php/` directory to a directory under your web server's root directory.
1. Modify the `credentials.php` file to include the values you obtained when registering your app, found in the [Google APIs Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/) under the *API Access* tab for the project.  This includes your OAuth client ID and client secret. You will also need to specify the database host, username and password. **Note:** Make sure you use a valid **Client ID for web applications**.  Do *not* use the **Client ID for Drive SDK**, which is reserved for future feature development.
1. Test the application.
